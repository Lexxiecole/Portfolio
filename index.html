<p id = "mgtext">I really enjoy exploring. Some of my favorite places in the United states are: Key West, Florida, Columbus, Ohio, and Kelly's Island, Ohio, and the Scottsdale Botanical Gardens. I am very intersted in traveling to Italy, Aruba, France, Bora-Bora, Costa Rica, and Australia. My favorite way to travel is by power-boat, however, I once sailed the British West Indies with my family, and I really enjoyed it. I hope to one day own a Capitan's License, and be able to fly a helicopter. I would like to learn to speak Spanish and possibly French as third and fourth languages. My second language is American Sign Language.</p>
